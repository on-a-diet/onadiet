/**
 * Release-setup gate.
 *
 * Two classes of release defect are invisible until a release is already in flight, and both produce the
 * worst shape of failure there is — a GREEN run that published the wrong thing, or nothing, irreversibly.
 * This script is the detector for both, so that "is the release setup still sound?" is a check rather than
 * a judgement call.
 *
 *   1. THE PACKAGE SET DRIFTED (offline). `release.yml` declares `PUBLISHED_PACKAGES` — the names this
 *      pipeline is expected to publish — and every per-package guard in it refuses to run without that
 *      list. It is a constant in a YAML file, so nothing keeps it true: add a package and the guards go on
 *      checking the old set, and the new name — which has no npm Trusted Publisher, because it has never
 *      been published — reaches `changeset publish` unguarded. Checking NAMES rather than a count also
 *      catches a rename, and one package removed while another is added, which leave a count unchanged.
 *      This check is what makes adding a package fail HERE, in CI, where the fix is to bootstrap the name,
 *      instead of failing mid-publish where some of the family is already on the registry, immutably.
 *
 *   2. THE APPROVAL GATE IS NOT ACTUALLY THERE (--environment, needs network). The publish job declares
 *      `environment: release`, which reads like a gate but is only a NAME. GitHub's documented behaviour is
 *      that "running a workflow that references an environment that does not exist will create an
 *      environment with the referenced name", and "the newly created environment will not have any
 *      protection rules". So if the environment was never created — or is deleted, or loses its reviewer —
 *      the publish job does not fail and does not pause. It publishes. The YAML is unchanged, the docs
 *      still describe an approval step, and the only evidence is a release that nobody approved.
 *      This repo shipped in exactly that state: `release.yml` and RELEASING.md both described the gate
 *      while the repo had zero environments configured.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-release.mjs                 # offline checks only
 *   node scripts/check-release.mjs --environment   # also verify the GitHub `release` environment
